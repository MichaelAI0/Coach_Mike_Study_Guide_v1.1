#  What is Object Oriented Programming in Ruby? 

In **Ruby**, an object is akin to a real-world entity, like a pen, chair, table, computer, or watch. 

Object-Oriented Programming (__OOP__) offers a structured approach to designing programs by utilizing classes and objects. 

This methodology streamlines software development and maintenance, integrating core concepts that are fundamental in Ruby: 

- **Object**: A basic unit representing a real-world entity, encapsulating data and behavior.
- **Classes**: Blueprints for creating objects, defining their structure and capabilities.
- **Inheritance**: A mechanism for a new class (subclass) to inherit properties and behavior from an existing class (superclass), promoting code reuse. 
- **Polymorphism**: The ability of different object types to respond in a distinct way to the same method call, enhancing flexibility in code interaction.
- **Abstraction**: The practice of exposing only the necessary details while hiding the complex implementation, making the interaction more straightforward.
- **Encapsulation**: The bundling of data and methods operating on the data within one unit or class, restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which ensures a controlled interaction with the object's properties.
